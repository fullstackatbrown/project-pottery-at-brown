			<p>
				Workshops are outdoor open 2-hour handbuilding sessions for club
				members looking for a lower commitment to pottery, yet
				interested in getting their hands dirty with clay! In Spring
				2024 we had two workshops, and will likely have one or two in
				Spring 2025. Make sure to stay posted on the email list.
